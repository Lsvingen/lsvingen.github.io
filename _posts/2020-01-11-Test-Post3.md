# Test

## Preface

While working on my [PoShDynDnsApi](https://github.com/thedavecarroll/PoShDynDnsApi){:target="_blank"} module, I came across an issue with
with a function I had predominantly borrowed from a [TechNet blog post from Jamie Nelson](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/janesays/2017/04/25/compare-all-properties-of-two-objects-in-windows-powershell/){:target="_blank"}.
Specifically, in my function `Update-DynDnsRecord` that called the `Compare-ObjectProperties` function, when I used the
`-WhatIf` parameter, I unexpectedly received the following:

```console
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: ipaddress Address {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: string Name {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: int TTL {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: string Type {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: string Zone {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: ipaddress Address {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: string Name {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: int TTL {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: string Type {get;set;}".
What if: Performing the operation "Retrieve the value for property 'Name'" on target "InputObject: string Zone {get;set;}".
```

The `Compare-ObjectProperties` seemed to be throwing these additional What If statements. I saw where the `ForEach-Object`
alias of `%` was used a few times and determined that these two lines were the cause.

```powershell
$objprops = $ReferenceObject | Get-Member -MemberType Property,NoteProperty | % Name
$objprops += $DifferenceObject | Get-Member -MemberType Property,NoteProperty | % Name
```
#### Script Blocks and -WhatIf

I had hoped that I could provide `-Begin`, `-Process`, and `-End` parameters along with `-WhatIf` as illustrated in the
following code:

```powershell
PS C:\> 'testing1','testing2' |  ForEach-Object -Begin {
    Write-Output 'Starting'
    } -Process {
        Write-Output "Processing $_"
    } -End { Write-Output 'Ending'
    } -WhatIf
```

## Conclusion

**Note:** I never considered forgoing advanced functions, just that the cmdlet could be an ad hoc supplement.
